Tools of the Trade
===
Before we get started learning HTML and becoming awesome web developers, we first need the right tools. Other than a computer, we need two additional tools to start coding. 

## Text editor

We write and save our code using a text editor. DO NOT use a program like Word for coding. Word processors (Microsoft Word, Pages, LibreOffice Writer, etc.) are not code friendly and will botch-up its formatting. Stick with one of the suggested text editors below. These are all **free** software: 

### Windows:

[Notepad++][1]

   [1]: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/

[Atom][2]

   [2]: https://atom.io/

### Mac OSX:

[TextWrangler][1] (Mac lab computers have this loaded)

[Atom][2]

Note: TextWrangler requires Mac OS 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or later. If your Mac is running anything before that, please contact the Tech Director ([thomas@everettprogram.org][3]) for a free upgrade to Snow Leopard. Otherwise use, [Smultron][4].

## Web Browser

Web browsers are what you view web pages with. You wouldnâ€™t be seeing this lesson or reading Reddit in class without one. Some web browsers are Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari (if you have a Mac) and Internet Explorer (there are others as well). For this class, please use the latest versions of either Firefox or Google Chrome!
